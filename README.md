WorldCup
========

Work with World Cap API and Apps script to get interesting insights
 

Improvments ideas
=================
  1. Integration with BigQuery to give more stats on match vs different worlds cap.
  2. Gain more data (e.g. bets, weather and http://fivethirtyeight.com/) to try and find better prediction.
